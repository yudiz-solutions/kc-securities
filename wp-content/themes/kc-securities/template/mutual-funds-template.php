                            <p>NAV is the total asset value (net of expenses) per unit of the fund and is calculated by the AMC at the end of every business day.</p>

                            <p>AMCs charge an annual fee, or expense ratio that covers administrative expenses, salaries, advertising expenses, brokerage fee, etc. A 1.5% expense ratio means the AMC charges Rs1.50 for every Rs100 in assets under management.
